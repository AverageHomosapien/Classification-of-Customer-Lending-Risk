# Classification of Customer Lending Risk
This was a 3rd year coursework done as part of the Data Analytics module.

## Overview
We were given a binary classification task - to group customers into 'good' and 'bad' lending opportunities for a bank.

We were required to prepare a messy dataset and then use classification, association and clustering to generate lending rules for the customers.

We used OpenRefine to clean the explore and clean the data.
We then used Weka to create the lending rules required.

I fully detail my approach in the 'Final Report.pdf' file.
